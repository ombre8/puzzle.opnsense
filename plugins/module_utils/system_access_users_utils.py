"""
This module manages user and group configurations within an OPNsense system. It provides
functionalities for handling user attributes and group memberships, utilizing data classes and
XML manipulation. Key features include creation, update, and deletion of user records,
secure password management, API key generation, and comprehensive error handling.

Classes:
- `User`: Manages individual user accounts with functionalities such as XML serialization and
  initialization from Ansible module parameters.
- `Group`: Manages group attributes and membership operations with XML interaction capabilities.
- `UserSet`: Handles bulk operations on users and groups, ensuring consistent state across the
  system configuration.

Exceptions are defined for handling specific group and API key validation errors, enhancing
the module's robustness in configuration management tasks.

Designed for Ansible integration, specifically targeting the OPNsense firewall system, this
module provides a structured approach to system access management.

    facilitating the management of users and groups through direct manipulation of the system's
    configuration file.

    The UserSet class provides a high-level interface to add, update, delete, and find users and
    groups in the system's configuration, abstracting the complexities of direct XML manipulation.
    It ensures that changes to users and groups are consistent and coherent, maintaining the
    integrity of the system's access control and configuration.

    Upon initialization, the class loads existing user and group configurations from the specified
    configuration file path, allowing for subsequent operations to reflect the current state of the
    system accurately. The class offers methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
    operations on user and group entities, alongside utility methods to check for changes and save
    updates back to the configuration file.

    Attributes:
        _users (List[User]): A list of User objects representing the users currently managed by
                             the system.
        _groups (List[Group]): A list of Group objects representing the groups currently managed
                               by the system.

    Methods:
        __init__(self, path: str): Initializes a new UserSet instance, loading users and groups
                                   from the specified configuration file.
        _load_users(self): Loads users from the system configuration into the _users list.
        _load_groups(self): Loads groups from the system configuration into the _groups list.
        add_or_update(self, user: User): Adds a new user or updates an existing one in the system.
        delete(self, user: User): Removes a specified user from the system's configuration.
        find(self, **kwargs): Searches for and returns a user matching specified criteria.
        save(self): Saves changes made to users or groups back to the system's configuration file.

    Usage:
        The UserSet class is intended for use within the OPNsense system's configuration management
        tools, providing a structured and safe approach to modifying user and group settings.

    Note:
        Modifications made through UserSet instances are not persisted automatically. The `save`
        method must be called to write changes back to the configuration file.

        Loads user data from the system's configuration and converts it into a list of User objects.

        This method accesses the 'system' element of the configuration, searching for all 'user'
        elements. Each found 'user' element represents a user configuration within the system.
        The method collects these elements, and for each one, it creates a User object by parsing
        the XML data into the structured format defined by the User data class.

        The conversion process relies on the `from_xml` class method of the User, which interprets
        the XML data and initializes a User object with the corresponding attributes extracted from
        the XML element.

        Returns:
            List[User]: A list of User objects representing all users found in the system's

        The process involves searching the XML for all 'group' elements, collecting these elements
